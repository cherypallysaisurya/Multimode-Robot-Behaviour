# Robot Behavior Examples

This folder contains example code and templates for the Robot Behavior Simulator.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### `minimal_api_examples.py`
**Complete working example** demonstrating the robot simulator features:
- Creates a 5x5 grid with walls
- Shows the robot moving in a sequence
- Demonstrates all basic movement commands
- Perfect for teachers to show students what's possible

**Run this example:**
```bash
python examples/minimal_api_examples.py
```

### `student_template.py`
**Starting template for students** to write their own algorithms:
- Pre-configured setup code
- Clear comments explaining available commands
- TODO sections where students add their logic
- Example movements commented out for reference

**Students can copy and modify this file:**
```bash
cp examples/student_template.py my_robot_algorithm.py
# Edit my_robot_algorithm.py with your own code
python my_robot_algorithm.py
```

## üéØ For Educators

Use `minimal_api_examples.py` to:
- Demonstrate the robot simulator capabilities
- Show students what their programs can achieve
- Test that the simulator is working correctly

Use `student_template.py` to:
- Give students a starting point for their assignments
- Ensure all students have the proper import structure
- Provide clear guidance on available commands

## üéì For Students

1. **First**: Run `minimal_api_examples.py` to see the robot in action
2. **Then**: Copy `student_template.py` and write your own algorithm
3. **Challenge**: Create interesting patterns, solve mazes, or implement pathfinding!

## üöÄ Student Assignment Ideas

- **Beginner**: Make the robot draw a square or triangle
- **Intermediate**: Navigate around obstacles to reach a goal
- **Advanced**: Implement maze-solving algorithms (BFS, A*, etc.)

Happy coding! ü§ñ
